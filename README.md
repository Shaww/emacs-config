Basic Emacs config.

Using MELPA to manage package dependencies and `use-package` to configure 
settings and configuration. 

Configuration may be wrong/inefficent as understanding of Emacs Lisp is
scratchy at best.  Probably missing some obvious mechanics, e.g. not using
the right hooks to trigger global configuration.

Look to setup Common Lisp environment with Slime and Swank.
